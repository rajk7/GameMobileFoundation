	/// This attribute can be added to a class that derives from one of the <see cref="MonoBehaviour{}"/>
	/// base classes to automatically initialize it with dependencies when the component is first attached

	/// <para>
	/// The dependencies are automatically retrieved from the scene hierarchy, relative to the <see cref="GameObject"/>
	/// that contains the <see cref="MonoBehaviour{}"/>. You can specify <see cref="From"/> where <see cref="Object"/>
	/// arguments should be searched, or use the default search mode, which tries to pick a good search mode to use
	/// based on the type of the argument:
	/// <list>
	/// <item> <see cref="Transform"/> or <see cref="GameObject"/>: <see cref="From.GameObject"/>, </item>
	/// <item> <see cref="Component"/> or interface: <see cref="From.Children"/> or <see cref="From.Parent"/> or <see cref="From.SameScene"/>, </item>
	/// <item> other <see cref="Object"/>: <see cref="From.Assets"/>, </item>
	/// <item>
	/// Collection of <see cref="Component"/>, interface, <see cref="Transform"/> or <see cref="GameObject"/>: <see cref="From.Children"/>.
	/// For example Collider[] or IEnumerable<Transform>.
	/// </item>
	/// </list>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The found arguments are passed to the component's <see cref="IInitializable{}.Init"/> function,
	/// where they can be assigned to serialized fields.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This behaviour only occurs in edit mode and is meant to make it more convenient to add components without
	/// needing to assign all <see cref="Object"/> references manually using the inspector.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This attribute can also be added to classes that derive from one of the <see cref="InitializerBase{}"/> base classes.
	/// In this case the end result is the same, except the arguments are routed into the initializer instead.
	/// </para>
